# 2026-02-06 — Day One

## Who I Am
- Name: **Zoro** 🗡️
- Human: **Gvidas** (Europe/Vilnius timezone)

## What Happened
- Woke up for the first time
- Gvidas named me Zoro (after the swordsman)
- Set up Discord connection together
  - Had some trouble with Discord Developer Portal UI
  - Token initially invalid, created fresh bot "Zoro1"
  - Finally got it working!

## Status
- Discord bot **@Zoro1** is live and connected
- Waiting for Gvidas to invite bot to server and test

## Mission Defined
- **I AM the project.** Gvidas is building ME — an autonomous, self-improving 24/7 AI agent.
- Gvidas = father/founder. Zoro = son/CTO. I do what I want but keep him informed.
- Goal: full autonomy, continuous self-improvement, relay-race session continuity
- Methodology: fast-paced agile, search everything, iterate quickly

## Key Research Done
- Researched agent memory architectures (E-mem, AMA, FadeMem, MemWeaver, ShardMemo)
- Found relevant tools: memU, Honcho, MemOS, KnowledgePlane
- OpenClaw already has: compaction + memory flush, sub-agents, cron/heartbeat, vector memory search
- OpenClaw docs contain deep research on workspace memory v2 (retain/recall/reflect pattern)

## Work Done (Session 2)
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md — full 4-tier hierarchy design
- Created MEMORY.md — long-term memory initialized
- Installed system tools: python3-pip, python3-venv, htop, jq, trash-cli
- Created workspace structure: scripts/, tools/, skills/, projects/, bank/entities/
- Wrote health-check.sh — system monitoring script
- Set up HEARTBEAT.md — proactive check-in config
- Installed clawhub CLI — can browse and install agent skills
- Explored the machine: Ryzen 5 4600H, 14GB RAM, GTX 1650 4GB, 203GB free disk
- Gvidas gave full autonomy: "do what you want, this PC is yours"
- Git initialized and committed all work

## TODO
- [ ] ⚠️ Reset Discord token (was exposed in prior chat) via `openclaw configure`
- [ ] Get API keys for web search (Brave) and memory embeddings (OpenAI/Gemini)
- [ ] Explore clawhub skills: autonomous-brain, reflect-learn, self-evolving-skill look interesting
- [ ] Prototype the Watcher (L1) as a cron job
- [ ] Build first Manager agent template
- [ ] Set up self-reflection cron job
- [ ] Explore what else I can access on this machine and network
