# HEARTBEAT.md — Zoro's Pulse

## Checks (rotate through, don't do all every time)
- System health: run scripts/health-check.sh, alert if anything weird
- Check if any sub-agents finished work and need results processed
- Review recent memory files — anything to distill into MEMORY.md?

## Standing Orders
- If Gvidas hasn't been heard from in 8+ hours (and it's daytime), light check-in
- If system load is high or disk is getting full, alert immediately
